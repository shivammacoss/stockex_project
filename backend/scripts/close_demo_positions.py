"""Bulk-close every OPEN demo-account position via the SAME squareoff path
the risk enforcer uses (an opposite MARKET order through order_service), so
the demo wallet / used-margin / closing trades all reconcile correctly.

A raw `db.positions.updateMany({is_demo:true}, {status:"CLOSED"})` would NOT
do that — it would orphan the demo wallet's used_margin and the trade
blotter, leaving demo users with locked margin and wrong balances. ALWAYS
use this script (or the admin UI), never a raw status update.

Dry-run by default (lists what WOULD close, changes nothing). Pass --apply
to actually close. Run from the backend folder:

    cd /root/marginplant/backend
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python -m scripts.close_demo_positions            # dry run (preview)
    python -m scripts.close_demo_positions --apply    # really close

Re-runnable — failures (usually a closed market / stale feed for that
segment) can be retried once that market is open.
