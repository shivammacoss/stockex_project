# queue and a single drainer task retries them once the pool frees up.
# The queue is hard-capped so a sustained outage cannot blow the
# process heap; oldest entries are dropped when the cap is hit and a
# Prometheus counter (`redis_publish_dropped_total`) records each drop
# so SREs can alert on it.
