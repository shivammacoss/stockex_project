"""Web Push send service — fires browser-vendor push messages so
operators get the deposit/withdrawal toast in the system tray even
when the PWA is force-stopped or the phone is locked.

Configuration:
    settings.VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY  — base64-encoded application-server key
    settings.VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY — matching private key (kept in env)
    settings.VAPID_SUBJECT     — mailto: contact (RFC 8292)

Generate the pair ONCE per deployment via:
    python -m scripts.generate_vapid_keys
The public key is also handed to the frontend (see /push/vapid-key
endpoint below) so the SW can subscribe to the same key pair.

Failure policy: every send is wrapped in try/except. A push hiccup
must NEVER block the calling request (deposit submit, wallet adjust,
…) or roll back a Mongo write. Failures log + swallow. A 404/410
response from the push service means the subscription is dead — we
delete the row so it stops cluttering the fan-out loop.
