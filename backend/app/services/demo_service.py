"""Shared demo account lifecycle.

The login page's "Try Demo" logs every visitor into ONE shared demo account
(see `auth_service.create_demo_session` / `GLOBAL_DEMO_EMAIL`) instead of
minting a throwaway per click. That single account accumulates everyone's
trades, so it must be flattened and re-funded on a schedule — otherwise its
open positions never close and the books drift. `reset_global_demo` does that
full wipe + 🪙5L restore; `main.py` calls it every 24h via `demo_reset_loop`.
