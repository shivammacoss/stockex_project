"""Daily instrument-expiry cleanup.

Background loop that runs every hour and applies the same rule the user
asked for:

    Expiry day  → instrument still shows / trades normally
    Day after   → instrument is removed from every user's watchlist,
                  unsubscribed from Zerodha, and marked inactive in the
                  Instrument collection so search stops returning it.

Idempotent — running twice in a row is a no-op once everything has been
swept. The loop exists so admins don't have to remember to nuke yesterday's
expired option chain manually.
