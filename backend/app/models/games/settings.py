"""GameSettings singleton — the master config for the whole games system.

One document only (enforced by a unique `key` index). `get_settings()` lazily
creates it and AUTO-HEALS any of the 7 known game blocks that are missing, so
adding a game to the schema never 404s an existing install (mirrors
`netting_service.get_global_risk`).

SuperAdmin is the only role that can write these. Hierarchy / referral fields
are stored but UNUSED in v1 (deferred — see plan §Decisions).
