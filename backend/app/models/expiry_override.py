"""Per-actor Expiry-Settings override.

Mirrors the segment-settings override pattern: one collection that stores
per-actor (USER / ADMIN / BROKER) overrides on top of the global
PlatformSetting "option_chain.underlyings" + "option_chain.max_expiries".

A None (vs empty []) field means "don't shadow this field — inherit from
the parent tier", so an admin can override only `max_expiries_fallback`
without re-stating the whole `underlyings` array.
